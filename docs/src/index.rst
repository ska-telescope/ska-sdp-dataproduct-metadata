SDP Data Product Metadata
=========================

The SDP Data Product Metadata is a python package which is designed to work for any data products.
This package helps to ensure that it records SKA-specific metadata. It would inform about the
following details:

    - Relevant context data which is provided by the Observation Execution Tool (OET)
    - Who created the data (including what software [versions] were used)
    - What is the purpose of the data recorded
    - When and where the data was recorded
    - What kind of data it is
